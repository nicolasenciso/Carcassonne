# Carcassonne
Custom game Carcassonne simple implementation

*Description:
Carcassonne is a game in which a single player attempts to build a map within the limits of a
board using squared tiles. The map will be constituted by tiles representing roads, abbeys and
cities. Each of these types of tiles give certain number of points to the player. The goal is for the
player to build the map that scores the highest.
Requirements:
-The total number of tiles which the player can play is ùëÅ ! where N is the length of a side of the
board.
- The board must be a 11x11 square.
- The player can put one (1) tile on the board per turn
- At the start of the game the player gets four (4) random tiles to select from and will be dealt a
new tile each turn, replacing the previously played tile.
- The player will never know what tile will be the next.
- The player should be able to discard their hand every 5 turns
- The game is played until the player can no longer play a tile, either because there are no
empty places or there are no valid placements for the tiles at hand.
- If the player cannot play a tile in their hand, the game will end unless the discard is available,
in which case, the player can do a discard.
- This game uses von Neumann Neighborhoods for adjacency: A tile is said to be adjacent to
another tile if they have a Manhattan distance of 1 unit from each other.
- A chain of tiles is a set of tiles where every tile is adjacent to at least one tile in the chain
- Road tiles score 1 point per tile and can only be placed in positions adjacent to road tiles, so
the chain keeps getting larger. The game starts with a single road tile in the center.
- Abbey tiles score 1 point per tile surrounding the abbey tile, so the maximum score a player
can get is 8 if an abbey tile is completely surrounded by other tiles. Abbeys must be placed
adjacent to any other tile.
- City tiles score 2 points per tile and can only be placed adjacent to cities, roads and/or abbey
tiles. City chains award an extra point for each city in the chain
- Tile dealing should not be completely random. Roads should be more likely to appear than
cities, and abbeys should be scarce. No fifteen (15) turns can happen without an abbey and at
least three (3) cities. How this is done is up to the implementor.

OPTIONS ADDED:
-You can add direction to road tiles, so each road tile indicates in which way must the road
grow: right-left, up-down, four-way crossing, three-way crossing, or corner tile. The game must
start with a four-way crossing road tile in the center
- Allow boards of different odd sizes.
- Allow different random tile generation algorithms
